PROMPT 02: FULL-STACK REQUIREMENTS GATHERING
================================================================================

USER REQUEST:
"Full-stack React with MLflow integration on the backend"

REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS:
1. Architecture: Full-stack application
2. Frontend: React framework
3. Backend: Node.js/Express (inferred from context)
4. Integration: MLflow tracking server via REST API
5. Purpose: Based on repo name, create validation interface for AI models

AI UNDERSTANDING:
- Need separate client and server directories
- Backend will communicate with MLflow REST API
- Frontend will communicate with backend API
- Validation workflow between end users and AI engineers

TECHNICAL DECISIONS MADE:
1. Build tool for React: Vite (modern, fast)
2. Backend framework: Express (lightweight, flexible)
3. API communication: Axios (both frontend and backend)
4. Routing: React Router for frontend navigation
5. CORS: Enabled for cross-origin requests

PROJECT STRUCTURE PLANNED:
Root/
├── server/           # Backend Express application
│   ├── routes/       # API endpoints
│   ├── services/     # Business logic, MLflow integration
│   └── server.js     # Main server file
├── client/           # Frontend React application
│   └── src/
│       ├── pages/    # Page components
│       ├── services/ # API client
│       └── components/
└── package.json      # Root dependencies and scripts

NEXT STEPS:
1. Install backend dependencies
2. Create server structure
3. Set up React frontend
4. Configure development workflow
