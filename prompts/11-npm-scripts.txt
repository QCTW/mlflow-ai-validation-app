PROMPT 11: NPM SCRIPTS CONFIGURATION
================================================================================

OBJECTIVE:
Configure package.json scripts for optimal development and build workflows

FILE: package.json (Root)

SCRIPTS ADDED:

1. "server": "nodemon server/server.js"
   Purpose: Run backend server with auto-reload
   How it works:
   - nodemon watches server/ directory
   - Automatically restarts on file changes
   - Great for development
   Usage: npm run server

2. "client": "cd client && npm run dev"
   Purpose: Run frontend dev server
   How it works:
   - Changes to client directory
   - Runs Vite dev server
   - Hot Module Replacement enabled
   - Opens browser automatically
   Usage: npm run client

3. "dev": "concurrently \"npm run server\" \"npm run client\""
   Purpose: Run both frontend and backend simultaneously
   How it works:
   - concurrently package runs multiple commands
   - Both servers start with one command
   - Output from both visible in terminal
   - Colored output for clarity
   Usage: npm run dev
   BENEFIT: Best developer experience

4. "install-all": "npm install && cd client && npm install"
   Purpose: Install all dependencies (root and client)
   How it works:
   - Installs root dependencies first
   - Then navigates to client
   - Installs client dependencies
   Usage: npm run install-all
   BENEFIT: Easy onboarding for new developers

5. "build": "cd client && npm run build"
   Purpose: Build production frontend bundle
   How it works:
   - Navigates to client directory
   - Runs Vite build command
   - Creates optimized bundle in client/dist/
   - Minified, tree-shaken, code-split
   Usage: npm run build
   BENEFIT: Production deployment preparation

6. "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
   Purpose: Placeholder for future tests
   Status: Not implemented yet
   Future: Could run Jest, Mocha, or other test framework

WORKFLOW PATTERNS:

First Time Setup:
```
git clone <repo>
npm run install-all
cp .env.example .env
cd client && cp .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

Daily Development:
```
npm run dev
# Make changes
# Both servers auto-reload
```

Separate Server Testing:
```
# Terminal 1
npm run server

# Terminal 2
npm run client
```

Production Build:
```
npm run build
# Serve client/dist/ with production server
```

CONCURRENTLY OUTPUT:
- [0] prefix: server output
- [1] prefix: client output
- Different colors for each process
- Exit on any process failure (optional)

NODEMON CONFIGURATION:
- Default: Watches all files in current directory
- Ignores: node_modules, .git
- Restarts on .js file changes
- Can be configured with nodemon.json if needed

VITE DEV SERVER:
- Port: 5173
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
- Fast refresh for React
- Instant feedback on changes

BENEFITS:

1. Developer Experience
   - Single command to start everything
   - Auto-reload on both frontend and backend
   - Fast iteration cycle

2. Consistency
   - Same commands for all developers
   - Documented in package.json
   - No need to remember complex commands

3. Onboarding
   - install-all makes setup trivial
   - Clear script names (self-documenting)

4. Production Ready
   - Build script for deployment
   - Separation of dev and production workflows

5. Extensibility
   - Easy to add more scripts
   - Can add testing, linting, etc.

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:
- Add "lint" script for ESLint
- Add "format" script for Prettier
- Add "test" script for Jest
- Add "deploy" script for production deployment
- Add "docker:build" for containerization

NEXT STEP:
Update README.md with comprehensive documentation
