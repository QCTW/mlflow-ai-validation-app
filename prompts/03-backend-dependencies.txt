PROMPT 03: BACKEND DEPENDENCIES INSTALLATION
================================================================================

OBJECTIVE:
Install necessary Node.js packages for backend server with MLflow integration

PRODUCTION DEPENDENCIES REQUIRED:

1. express
   Purpose: Web application framework
   Why: Industry standard, minimal, flexible for REST APIs

2. cors
   Purpose: Enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
   Why: Frontend (localhost:5173) needs to communicate with backend (localhost:5000)

3. dotenv
   Purpose: Load environment variables from .env file
   Why: Secure configuration management (MLflow URI, ports, etc.)

4. axios
   Purpose: HTTP client
   Why: Make requests to MLflow REST API from backend

DEVELOPMENT DEPENDENCIES REQUIRED:

1. nodemon
   Purpose: Auto-restart server on file changes
   Why: Improves developer experience during development

2. concurrently
   Purpose: Run multiple npm scripts simultaneously
   Why: Run both frontend and backend with single command

COMMANDS EXECUTED:
npm install express cors dotenv axios
npm install --save-dev nodemon concurrently

OUTCOME:
- 79 production packages installed
- 52 dev packages installed
- 0 vulnerabilities
- package.json updated with dependencies
- node_modules/ directory created
- package-lock.json generated

NEXT STEP:
Create backend directory structure and server files
